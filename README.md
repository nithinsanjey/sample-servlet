# sample-servlet

IDE used - Eclipse
Create a dynamic web project and clone this repo into it.

JDK - 1.8.0_161

Database used - MySQL57

You will be needing database connector jar to be added to build path and lib folder in WEB-INF. I have used mysql-connector-java-5.1.45-bin.jar. 

A few tables needs to be created. Refer WiKi doc for table structure and more. https://github.com/nithinsanjey/sample-servlet/wiki

## Overview
An application to take notes with time log. Wanted to create a sample servlet application along with how I went about creating the project project. More happy that I got to write about OO project creation.
Ideally I should have clearly defined the requirements first, but here the requirements are naturally evolving :) .

See wiki page for journal entry of how I went about this project.
